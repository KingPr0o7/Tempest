# Disclaimer
My project 'Tempest' is based on my English teacher's project outline. It wasn't my idea for the pages created. The project required an overview, underlying meaning, and related links. However, all the styles (looks and feel), credits page, text for overview page, text for an underlying meaning, link's suggested uses, and link descriptions are my ideas and created/written by me. 

I also don't own the song or images except for the verification check marks and my logo. Every source is credited and linked to the original origin on the website. 

# Main Idea
This website was a final project for Q3 2023 school year. The goal was to encapsulate the ideas of the play "The Tempest" written by William Shakespeare to present to the class. With that, it also added an element of research to entice deeper learning and critical thinking for the making of the play. There were many different options and variations of these fundamentals so that students target their preferred skills. Including but not limited to drawing, programming, singing, talking, presenting, and craftsmanship.
